# Astro Patterns

## General

- Always use the latest version of Astro. If you're not sure, check.
- Use Astro components for static content
- React components only when interactivity needed
- Leverage Astro's partial hydration
- Use content collections for structured data
- Keep bundle size minimal with selective hydration

## Adapters

- Always use `@astrojs/vercel` and assume Vercel for hosting

## Database

- For a new project, always initially use Astro DB, Astro's included database
