# Next.js Patterns

- Always refer to the latest version of Next.js
- Always use Next.js app directory
- Always use Next.js serve - Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Use next/image for all images
- Keep API routes thin, business logic in separate filesr components, unless client-side reactivity is required

## Validation

- Prefer use `zod` for validation

## Forms

- Prefer Tanstack Form

## Authentication

- Prefer use `better-auth`
