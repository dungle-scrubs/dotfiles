Use git mcp to generate meaningful commits from my working directory using Conventional Commit syntax.

    Analyze how changes relate to one another.

    Use memory mcp if needed to understand context.

    Group changes into commits that are logically cohesive — no more, no less.

    Ensure each commit message reflects the intent and scope of the change.
